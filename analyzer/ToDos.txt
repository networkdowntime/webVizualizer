Might be able to adapt this to save the images to a PDF: from http://nesterko.com/blog/2012/01/30/measuring-homophily-in-network-data-and-how-to-export-from-d3-js-to-pdf/

	var html = d3.select("svg")
        	.attr("title", "test2")
	        .attr("version", 1.1)
        	.attr("xmlns", "http://www.w3.org/2000/svg")
	        .node().parentNode.innerHTML;
	d3.select("body").append("div")
	        .attr("id", "download")
	        .html("Right-click on this preview and choose Save as<br />Left-Click to dismiss<br />")
	        .append("img")
	        .attr("src", "data:image/svg+xml;base64,"+ btoa(html));

Or maybe follow this to save as an image: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3975499/convert-svg-to-image-jpeg-png-etc-in-the-browser

General ToDos:
	Disable view pane if there is nothing to show
	Add Loading spinner to view pane
	For sidebars, add menu loading spinners when waiting for data
	Improve/standardize transitions on sidebars

DB ToDos:

	Add support for multiple concurrent database connections
	
	Need to add ability to filter by Created/Updated timestamps.  Would allow the user to identify tables based on most recent usage

	Need to improve the aesthetics of the generated graphs.  Probably though the use of SVG Filters and maybe d3js

	Add Option to save connection information.  Preferably using the browser's password save feature.

	Add Auto-Connect to DB on load

	Add Support for multiple saved DB Connections

	Add ability to guess missing FK constraints based on naming convention

	Add deep table scan to gives you information on the structure of the data in the tables:
		Such as the number of distinct values in each column.
		Usage frequency maps

	Allow the DB structure to be persisted to disk and reloaded.  Will reduce the round trips to the DB and allow you to work offline.

	Allow for export of the shown tables and or FK constraints

	Add support for Postgres
	
	Add an inclusive filter for table names (only show tables like/in the filter list)
	
	Add ability to save a filter settings under a name and then load it again.  Providing the ability to switch between different views of the database. 

	Add ability to show additional details on a table (constraints, all columns, additional details)
	
Java ToDos:
	Add Java to the analyzer
		Select/Scan Directory
		Add Library Resources
		Package Selector
			Scan Packages
			Show Package Dependencies
		Class Selector - allows inclusion/exclusion of classes
	Add JSP parser

	Show possible method call paths.  Select method/JSP and it generates a directed graph of the method calls
		Call path complexity report.

	Add Support for detecting if a class is a Web Service (Spring, Jersey, Jackson, ...)

	Show probable dead code.  Computes all method call paths.  
	Remove all methods used in call paths for system inputs (Web Service, Servlet, JSP, Spring, Struts, ...).  Display remaining method call paths.

	Overlay log file analysis on graph.  Allows you to identify dead system inputs.  Hot-spot stacktraces in the logs to the causing class.

	Live Updates.  Watches the timestamps on the scanned files/directories and auto-updates the graph

	View code: class view, method view (syntax highlighting)

	Add round-trip
		Create packages with the viewer
		Create classes with the viewer
		Define class relationships with the viewer
		Remove classes/methods/references with the viewer
		Direct editing of the class from the code viewer


Hybrid ToDos:
	Show tables used by the Java Code
		AutoDetect table names in Strings, Property Files, JPA, Hibernate, Top Link, ...
	
	Show tables that don't appear to be used by the Java Code
